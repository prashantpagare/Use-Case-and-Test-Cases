Dos:



Have questions regarding Software Testing that a candidate is likely to encounter.
Questions should involve reasoning from and extension of known concepts as much as possible.




Donâ€™ts:



Each question must test understanding of the concept and not mere memorization: No student must be able to answer a question because he/she recollects the same script as the question from a resource. This does not merely imply changing the syntax of the question.
Obscure or very niche terms/ concepts must not be tested. No student must be unable to answer a question because the question tests recollection of an arcane term.
